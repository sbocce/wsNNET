This folder contains some trained models for the neural net, saved from Keras in h5 format.
In the IMGS folder, some plots of the error. 

############

The models are trained in the interval q_star in (-70,70) and sigma in (1E-5, 1).
These variables are transformed into theta = asinh(10000*q_star) and xi = log10(sigma).
Therefore the actual range is:
theta in (-14.1519827945... , 14.1519827945...)
and 
xi in (-5, 0).

############

The neural net models can be evaluated using Octave. As an example, refer to the scripts in the uplevel directory:

- octaLoadAndUseNet.m
- apply_saved_net.m
